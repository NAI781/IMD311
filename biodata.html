    <h1><span>Nur Alifah Ilyana Binti Zulkafli</span></h1>
    <p><b>I made this website as my personal blog about myself. I was born on <span class="date">August 7, 2001</span> in <span class="place">Hospital of Malacca.</p></b>
    <p><b>I'm studying in semester 5 for now at <span class="study">UiTM Rembau</span> and I took <span class="course">Infomation Management as my main course.</span></p></b>
    <p><b>At first, I was planning to continue my study in <span class="subject">English as Second Communication</span> because I love English literature.</p></b>
    <p><b>I do not have the guts to go to the interview because of my anxiety, so I decided to take Information Management <br>instead because the course does not including mathematic and calculating.</br></p></b> 
    <p><b>My favourite colour is purple and black. Other than that, I'm a foodie. I love to do food hunting.</p></b>
    <p><b>I like to drink iced coffee because I do not really enjoy sweet drinks.</p></b>
