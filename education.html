<b>
<p>I was studying at SK Padang Temu Melaka from standard 1 until standard 4. Then I got transferred to SK Wira in Pahang because my dad was getting promotion in 2011.</p>
<p>Things get a little bit complicated when I had to move out back to Melaka in 2013. I went to SK Padang Temu when I was standard 6. I met new friends in the year of UPSR.</p>
<p>After the exam, I decided to go to all girls school in Melaka which is Melaka Girls' High School. I studied from 2014 until 2018. I graduated from the same school.</p>
<p>Few months later, I get offered to study in public university which is UiTM Rembau, Negeri Sembilan. I took diploma in Information Management.</p> 
<p>Currently I am studying at semester 5. I am learning coding subject which I have to do a website about myself and here is the result. Not the best, but I am trying.</p>
<p>I decided to not continue my degree studies because I'm the eldest daughter and I want to help my family in financial.</p>
