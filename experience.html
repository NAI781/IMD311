        <p>I want to share my experience travel alone. I have been to Bukit Bintang Kuala, Port Dickson, Seremban, and going back alone from my campus to my house.</p>
        <p>The first time I travel by myself was in 2020 where I went to my cousin's house in Klang, Selangor. It was semester break and I decided to visit her and her family.</p>
        <p>I took a bus from Melaka Central and straightaway go to Klang Central. She fetch me after I arrived at the bus station and brought me to her home.</p>
        <p>Next, I went to Seremban by KTM train from Rembau. I met my best friend since high school because she was studying in UiTM Seremban, Negeri Sembilan.</p> 
        <p>We had fun because I have not met her for a year. We spent time together chatting and eating at the mall near the place. It was nice to have experience using train alone.</p>
        <p>I also went to Port Dickson and eventually stay one night. I was trying to release my tension and stress. I thought that a short vacation would help and it really do.</p>
        <p>I never went to Kuala Lumpur before not until last year, 2021. In November of 2021, I went to Bukit Bintang using train and other public transport.</p> 
        <p>I didn't know that Bukit Bintang is a huge city that has a lot of high buildings. It makes me feel small when I walk around the city.</p>
        <p>To be very honest, going to Kuala Lumpur is not enough for 2 days and 1 night. There are so many places to visit such as Central Market.</p>
